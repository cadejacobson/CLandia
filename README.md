# CLandia

## Background

Hey! Do you enjoy seeing that DOOM has been run on nearly every electronic
device ever made? For some reason, this little gimmick fascinates me 
everytime it is done. After seeing it so many times, I have grown interested
in learning how the computer creates graphics at a very low level
to the point that this game can be run on every device known to man.

Obviously, there is no way to build something like Unity in my spare time,
but a small DOOM engine? Perfectly sized project.


### Name
For those of you who spend your time doing more productive things than
reading about the history of Dutch sailing, the Selandia was the first
ship with a proper engine. This is also my first attempt at creating an engine,
for which I am using C. The first Sea Engine (C Engine) was on the Selandia,
or CLandia (very bad pun, but I needed it to not go to waste).


## Building

Currently, the program is built through CMake. No one else has yet built the
engine, so I can not give any tips for the correct trouble shooting
techniques. My email and instagram are in my profile, so please get 
in touch if you have any issues.
